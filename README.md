#### Project overview

This C++ framework is a modular, extensible platform for designing, backtesting, and deploying systematic options strategies focused on SPX index options. It combines a clean runtime architecture—market‑data ingestion, pluggable strategy modules, order and position management, and risk controls—with a research‑driven approach so strategy logic, sizing, and hedging are informed by contemporary academic methods rather than ad‑hoc heuristics.

#### Academic grounding

The framework is explicitly informed by four research themes common in recent arXiv/SSRN literature: 

- stochastic control for multi‑leg option portfolios 
- empirical modeling of option price and implied‑volatility surface dynamics,
- hedging and transaction‑cost aware sizing, 
- multi‑factor / rough volatility models for realistic tail and IV behavior. 

Concretely, entry/exit rules are framed as control objectives (state = spot, IV surface, time‑to‑expiry), pricers and simulators accept evolving IV surfaces learned or calibrated from historical option data, and risk/hedging modules implement rebalancing policies and cost penalties derived from empirical hedging studies.

#### Design implications

The architecture maps the four research themes into concrete modules:

- Control‑based strategy: entry/exit as stochastic control objectives (state = spot, IV surface, time‑to‑expiry).
- Pluggable pricers & IV simulators: empirical/ML or rough‑vol models can be swapped into the pricer interface for realistic option paths and Greeks.
- Empirical hedging & sizing: RiskManager encodes hedging cadence, transaction costs, and sizing rules from hedging studies.
- Data & calibration pipeline: ingest historical SPX/VIX/option chains, build IV surfaces, calibrate multi‑factor models or train empirical simulators for backtests.

#### Short technical summary

The codebase remains modular: 
- strategies implement a control interface
- market data supports both live (Yahoo polling or vendor feeds) and replay;
- pricers and IV simulators are swappable
- risk/position managers enforce empirically motivated constraints.

This structure lets researchers and engineers iterate on model choices (empirical surface, NN simulators, rough‑vol calibration) without rewriting core execution and bookkeeping logic.
